        desc: "The #VersaceSS22 collection is built from Versace’s iconic silk foulard. 'The foulard is a fundamental component of Versace’s heritage and character. It’s acted as a canvas for our iconic prints and is worn in multiple ways from knotted tops to headscarves to bag accessories, it’s a way of adding Versace attitude to any look. The foulard has been with us since the very beginning of the brand, but this season turns everything on its head, it is no longer fluid or dreamy, the scarf is provocative, sexy, wound tight.' Donatella Versace The transformational nature of the scarf means it can become anything, from billowing shirts to sexy, shrunken-fit dresses. Combined with iconographical prints, the designs feel thrown together, unfinished and unpolished. It’s as if the pieces have been ripped apart and rapidly stitched back together again. Slashes in the garments are haphazardly fastened together by the brand’s iconic Safety Pins. Modernized in a selection of vibrant colors, the Safety Pins become both functional fastening and bold embellishment. Scarves tightly wrap the body and are punctuated by seemingly randomly placed hardware. A textural diversion comes in the form of sleek latex dresses, tops and skirts in a shocking palette. Ornate prints are a defining feature of the Versace foulard. This season there’s a celebration of brand code La Greca, as well as fresh designs. Royal Rebellion presents crowns and crests in bold colorways, and Banquet Aftermath features dishes and cutlery from the Versace Home collection - the cutlery is also translated to knife and fork jewelry. Acid Bouquet is Versace’s answer to spring florals and is characteristically unromantic in clashing acid tones. Menswear also stems from the foulard and presents relaxed, loose-fit pieces in printed silk. A fundamental principle of Versace menswear is the silk shirt, which originally evolved from the printed scarf. Relaxed shirting and pajama sets are clashed against form-fitting activewear, skintight latex and flirty handkerchief tops. Sharp tailoring is presented in fluo tones of yellow, orange, pink and blue. New silhouettes and shades are introduced to the La Medusa handbag line, including a large open tote and a drawstring-top bucket style, both with embedded chain details. There are also new colorways of the La Greca Signature line. Scarves are attached to handles and draped from bags, tying the accessories line-up to the vibrant foulard-inspired collection.",

        desc: "I have always loved a rebel. A woman who is confident, smart and a little bit of a diva. She wears leather, studs and frayed denim and she has enough attitude to mix them with chiffon, jersey, and a tiara! She is a strong liberated woman; she is gorgeous; she knows it. She is the Goddess of Freedom.” — Donatella Versace A dark gothic goddess. That's the woman in mind this season. Black, purple, and hints of fuchsia are the colors running through the whole collection, coming together in looks both high-glamour and hard-edged, diva and subversive. Singular slashes cut across dresses and tops, while a series of precision cuts come together as graphic pattern details. Tough leather becomes fringing across biker jackets, leather pants and skirts. Jackets are worn over cascading chiffon dresses and skirts with macramé flourishes, creating a clash of structured and fluid forms, composure and impulsion. Slinky silhouette-enhancing dresses are finished in shiny metallic jersey. Shaggy, fur-like coats and miniskirts are crafted from upcycled production off-cut chiffon and lace in an environmentally responsible approach. Metal studs are full-on, covering leather pants and jackets, and piercing through delicate lace in a play with material contrast. Prints have a brooding glow in the collection’s colors of dark orchid purple and tropical pink. The multi-logo ‘Versace on Repeat’ print, and floral and zebra patterns interplay and are incorporated into laminated lace, fil coupé, intarsia, or metal stud finishes. Bags in the La Medusa line, including La Medusa Repeat, the re-edition hobo bag style introduced for Resort 2023, take-on the collection’s stud, leather fringe, and mirror material finishes, while the classical elegance of the Greca Goddess bag is made utterly contemporary in new glossy green and purple colors. The new Medusa Anthem shoe line clashes cutesy sandal, boot, and Mary Jane styles with a heavy-metal XL rubber sole made for the Versace club-kid.",

What is less well known is that the insatiable fast fashion business model is enabled by cheap plastic, or synthetic fibres, which are produced from fossil fuels, mostly oil and gas. The Changing Markets Foundation has undertaken ground-breaking research into fashion brands’ addiction to fossil fuels and exposed their lack of plans to transition away from this dirty production.  To date the fashion industry’s reliance on fossil fuels has flown mostly under the radar. Fast fashion, working conditions and waste have dominated the headlines. But work by the Changing Markets Foundation has highlighted that this is a crisis that cannot be ignored. Coinciding with COP26, this video aims to show the hypocrisy of fashion brands, who are making top line commitments to climate action, while behind the scenes they double down on using fossil fuels to make clothes and drag their feet on putting in place real science-based climate plans. The campaign calls for prompt, transformative legislative action to slow down the fashion industry and decouple it from fossil fuels.",
